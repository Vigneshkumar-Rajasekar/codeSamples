Hi Reviewer,

I attached samples of my codes and formats which can show what technologies and details I experienced with. 
-> These samples are just 5 to 10% of my real time work. Behalf of code review, I created a new project and written some piece of code with junit test cases to represent the nature of work. 
-> And for web application, copied a piece of code for which I was rewarded and recognized as star performance of the year. 
-> The particular dashboard application was the highly selling point in 2018 for our Europe clients. "Mentioned this to Mr.Jonathan El-Sharkawy" and he was very much impressed. That's why I attached the dashboard image which was sent from Philips Warehouse.

I attached 2 set of codes as mentioned below,
1. Microservice-Boot
2. Web Dashboard
-----------------------------------------------

1. Microservice-Boot
----------------------
-> I created a sample maven project in java with spring boot 2.6.0
-> Developed a sample java class with Rest controller to get 3 different mapping. 1 is just returning string for the url, 2 is returning a pojo class as JSON, 3 is returning a JSON with respect to input argument.
-> Written a junit cases running with SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class
-> To host a dummy service, I used MockMvcBuilders.
-> To get the mock request, I used MockMvcRequestBuilders
-> To compare the string output, I used MockMvcResultMatchers.content()
-> To compare the JSON output, I used MockMvcResultMatchers.jsonPath()

2. Web Dashboard
----------------------
-> Copied my operational dashboard screen HTML and javascript code pieces.
-> By using native javascript and HTML, done this screen which gives very good look and feel like latest javascript libraries.
-> Attached stylesheets to show sample styles.


Note: I have given just a samples of all the codes. Ethically I should not reveal my live codes, thats why I attached some piece of codes and samples for microservices.

Thanks & Regards,
